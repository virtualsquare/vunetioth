.SH DESCRIPTION
\f[CB]iplink\f[R] allow users to add or delete interfaces whose types
are not supported by \f[CB]ip\-link\f[R](8).

.TP
\f[CB]name\f[R] \f[I]NAME\f[R]
sets the name of the new interface.
(the tag \f[CB]name\f[R] can be omitted).
.TP
\f[CB]index\f[R] \f[I]IDX\f[R]
specifies the desired index of the new virtual device.
.TP
\f[CB]data\f[R] \f[I]DATA\f[R]
adds specific data to configure the interface.
The meaning depends upon the type of the interface.
.SS iplink del \[en] iplink delete
\f[CB]iplink del\f[R] or \f[CB]iplink delete\f[R] deletes an interface.
At least one option between \f[CB]dev\f[R] or \f[CB]index\f[R] must be
selected.
.TP
\f[CB]dev\f[R] \f[I]DEVICE\f[R]
select the interface by its name.
(the tag \f[CB]dev\f[R] can be omitted).
.TP
\f[CB]index\f[R] \f[I]IDX\f[R]
select the interface by its index.
.TP
\f[CB]type\f[R] \f[I]TYPE\f[R]
specify the interface type (currently ignored).
